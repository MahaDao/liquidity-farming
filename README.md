The source for the Liqudity Farming module that'll get deployed along with the ARTH stablecoin smart contracts. Code taken from Compound finance.

## Deployed Contracts

### Kovan

- Reward Token: 0xaDD60aA601217F6d34C80495C556ab0D245747c3
- LP Token: 0xC1D32520113bbBb6E6522E78C9aaF4791A976844
- Farm: 0x94635861fF6eaF8F47112263C67D1828E752CD52

## Requirements

There should be 3 contracts.

- Erc20 (ARTH, 18 decimals) Mintable, burnable, ownable.

- Maha token (MAHA, 18 decimals) premined
  Farming contract

How it should work:

When minted the user should get the percentage of the blockrate as per his % of the total minted token.

Eg. User 1 mints 100 ARTH.
The block rate is 80 MAHA.
User 1 has minted 100 out of 100 arth so they will be give 80 MAHA every block.
User 2 come and mints 100 more ARTH.
User 2 has minted 100 out of 200 ARTH so User 1 and User 2 would get 40 MAHA.
They both have minted 50% of the total supply.

Major changes to Unicrypt code

- Change LPsupply to totalsupply of ARTH.
- Here transferFrom happens AFTER LPsupply is calculated so if \_mint is called first then the state of totalsuplly changes before we want it to.
- Instead of transfer from we can use mint function of the arth erc20
- Instead of \_mint of the farm token we will use transfer as the MAHA token is premined.
